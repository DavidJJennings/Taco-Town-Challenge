# Overview
This project demonstrates your understanding of back-end development, JSON manipulation, objects, arrays, Express.js, and middleware. It creates an interactive website that displays different taco recipes to users using HTTP GET and POST methods.

# Features
## Interactive Interface: The website allows users to choose their favorite taco ingredients using three buttons (chicken, beef, fish).

## Dynamic Recipe Display: Upon selecting an ingredient, the website dynamically updates to display the corresponding taco recipe with ingredients such as protein type, salsa, and toppings.

# Project Structure
index.js: The back-end server code built with Express.js.
index.ejs: The front-end HTML template that renders the website interface.

# Technologies Used
Node.js: For server-side scripting.
Express.js: To build the web server and handle HTTP requests.
EJS: As the templating engine to generate dynamic HTML content.
JSON: To store and parse recipe data.
Body Parser Middleware: To handle POST request data.
